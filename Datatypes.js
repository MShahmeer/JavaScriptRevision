//Modern JS is different from the old JS, there were no modules, classes, arrow functions etc 
//To write the code in the new version we use "Use Strict" in our code file but now its also not used

// alert(3+3) this will not run in the node js because we can only run this in browser

//you can get the JS official documentation of ECMA from here https://tc39.es/ecma262/ or MDN

// same as datatypes in programming languages

// null is the standalone value in JS and datatype of null is object, while undefined is datatype

// Symbol is the datatype as well
